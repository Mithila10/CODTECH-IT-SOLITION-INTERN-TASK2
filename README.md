IN MY SECOND TASK I HAVE COMPLETED MY WEATHER FORCAST APP USING html,css,java script.. 
overview of my project
1. HTML Structure (index.html)
The HTML file defines the layout and structure of the weather app’s user interface. Here’s a breakdown of its key components:

Meta Tags: Defines the character set and viewport settings for the web page.

Title: Sets the title of the web page to "Weather App".

Link to Stylesheet: Connects the HTML file to an external CSS file (style.css) for styling purposes.

Body Structure: The <body> tag holds all visible content of the app.

Container (div.container): Acts as the main wrapper for the entire weather app. It sets a maximum width, background color, border-radius, and box-shadow to create a visually appealing container.

Wrapper (div.wrapper): Divides the content into two main sections using CSS Grid:

.img_section: Displays the background image along with current weather information such as day, date, weather icon, temperature, and description.
.content_section: Contains:
A search form (form) consisting of an input field (input_field) for users to enter a location and a search button (btn_search) to initiate the search.
.day_info: Displays details about the current weather at the searched location, including location name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
.list_content: Presents a list (ul) of upcoming weather forecasts for the next few days. Each forecast item (li) includes a weather icon, abbreviated day name, and forecasted temperature.
2. CSS Styling (style.css)
The CSS file (style.css) enhances the visual appearance and layout of the weather app:

Global Styling (*): Resets margins, paddings, and box-sizing to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.

Body Styling: Sets a background image for the entire page with properties to center and cover the image.

Container Styling (div.container): Defines styles for the main container, including background color, border-radius, box-shadow, and width.

Grid Layout (div.wrapper): Utilizes CSS Grid to structure the app into two columns (3fr and 4fr), providing a responsive and balanced layout.

Background Styling (div.img_section): Enhances the visual appeal of the background image by applying a background-position, background-repeat, and background-size properties. Also, uses pseudo-elements (::before) to overlay a gradient for better readability of the text over the background image.

Typography and Content Styling: Defines font families (Poppins and Ruda), font sizes, colors, and spacing for various elements such as headings, paragraphs, and buttons to ensure readability and consistency.

Form and Input Styling: Customizes the appearance of the search form, including input field (input_field) and search button (btn_search), with properties like border-radius, background color, and padding.

Weather Display Styling: Styles weather icons (img), temperature (h2.weather_temp), and weather description (h3.cloudtxt) within the .img_section.

Forecast List Styling (ul.list_content): Formats the list of forecasted weather items (li) using flexbox for alignment, transitions for smooth hover effects, and box-shadow for a subtle visual lift on hover.

Animation (@keyframes): Defines a fadeIn animation to gradually reveal elements (.icons) with opacity.

3. JavaScript Functionality (script.js)
The JavaScript file (script.js) provides dynamic functionality to the weather app:

Constants and Variables: Defines constants for the API key (API_KEY) and selects HTML elements using querySelector.

Day Names Array (days): Stores the names of the days of the week (Sunday through Saturday) for displaying current day and forecast day names.

Event Listener (btn_search): Listens for clicks on the search button (btn_search) to trigger the findLocation function, which fetches weather data based on the user’s input.

Fetch Weather Data (findLocation): Uses the fetch API to request weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API (api.openweathermap.org). The function constructs the API URL with the user’s location input (locationName) and API key (API_KEY). Upon receiving a response, it checks for errors (cod !== "404") and displays the current weather information (displayImageContent, rightSideInfo) and forecasts (displayForecast) if successful.

Display Functions:

Current Day and Date: Uses Date objects and toLocaleDateString method to display the current day of the week (currentDayName) and formatted date (currentDate).
Current Weather (displayImageContent): Generates HTML content for displaying weather icons, temperature, and description based on the fetched weather data (weatherData).
Right Side Content (rightSideInfo): Constructs HTML content for displaying location name, temperature, humidity, and wind speed based on the fetched weather data (weatherData).
Forecast Display (displayForecast): Fetches and displays upcoming weather forecasts (forecastData) for the next few days based on latitude (latitude) and longitude (longitude) coordinates from the fetched weather data.
Error Handling: Catches and logs errors (catch) encountered during the fetch operations to the console (console.error) for debugging purposes.

Template Functions:

Forecast Template (forecastTemplate): Generates HTML content for each forecast item (forecast) based on forecasted weather data (forecastData), including weather icons, abbreviated day names, and forecasted temperatures.
Conclusion
The weather app seamlessly integrates HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality to provide users with an intuitive interface for checking current weather conditions and forecasts. By leveraging these technologies and APIs, the app offers a responsive and visually appealing experience, ensuring users can easily access weather information for their desired locations worldwide.
